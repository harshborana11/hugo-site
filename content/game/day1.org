#+summary: "this is day 1 of me making a game "

* starting of the project
i made some basic functions and files which will contain the new game and contunue fame function.
New game fnuction and contunue game function are just skeletons and i have yet to add the funcion to actually make it work
added save file dir cheaker and listing the save files later the code to load and play will be added,

#+begin_src c
void continue_game() {

    char gamefile[256];
    get_game_save(gamefile);

    printf("%s \n", gamefile);

    if (strcmp(gamefile, "0") == 0) {
        printf("you should start new game, there are no save files");
        return;
    }

    // logic to load game will be added later

    printf("game continues with the save file : %s \n", gamefile);
}
#+end_src

 and i also created this website to record my daily progress
